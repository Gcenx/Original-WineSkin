# Wineskin
Wineskin is a tool used to make ports of Windows software to Mac OS X. 

## About
Ports are in the form of normal Mac application bundle wrappers.  It works like a wrapper around the Windows software, and you can share just the wrappers if you choose. Make ports/wrappers to share with others, make ports of your own open source, free, or commercial software, or just make a port for yourself!  Why install Windows if you donâ€™t need to?
